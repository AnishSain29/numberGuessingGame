__Number Guessing Game__
This is a console-based Number Guessing Game developed in Java that provides an interactive experience for users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program is designed to improve basic Java programming skills by utilizing core concepts such as loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation.

__Game Logic__
At the start of each round, the program generates a random number between a predefined lower and upper bound (e.g., 1 to 100).
The player is given a limited number of attempts (default is 5) to correctly guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback:
"Too high!" if the guess is greater than the target number.
"Too low!" if the guess is less than the target number.
"Correct!" if the guess matches the number.

__Multiple Rounds__
After each round, the user is prompted to play again.
The game continues until the user chooses to exit.

__Scoring System__
The player earns 1 point for each correct guess within the allowed attempts.
The total score is displayed at the end of all rounds.

__Technologies Used__
Java (Core Java, Console Input/Output)
Scanner class for user input
Random class for number generation
